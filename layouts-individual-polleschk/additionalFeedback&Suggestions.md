### Extra Lab Questions & Suggestions & Enjoyed
1. Lab length - too long, too short
2. Difficulty - easy, hard
3. Wording 
   1. how easy/difficult is it to read and know what you have to do 
   2. too wordy - too many words to explain what is necessary 
   3. not clear - more detailed explanation required
4. Likes/dislikes - what you liked/disliked
5. Other suggestions - would this have been beneficial had we done the lab this year? etc.

### Answers

1. Lab length - I think that the lab length would have been better if there was two people, it might have been more manageable. Doing this lab alone took a long time because there was so much research to do.
2. Difficulty - With the provided links to W3Schools this lab was fairly straightforward. I think that the lab was a good difficulty level, it was challenging but not too hard.
3. Wording - The wording of the [README.md](README.md) was very clear with not too many words. The `Hints and Tips` also in the `Testing and Debugging` parts are empty so that would have been nice to have included when working on the lab. Other than that all the instructions were clear and easy to understand. 
4. Likes - I liked exploring how to format different parts of a HTML page just with CSS and not doing anything within the HTML file. I also liked how the lab was broken down into smaller parts so that it was easier to manage.
5. Dislikes - I disliked how much research there was even though it did help when doing the exercises. 
6. Other suggestions - Finally I think this lab could be divided up nicely between partners, giving both people a chance to work on different parts of the lab, and making sure they get an even amount of work, maybe this should be adapted for other labs as well.

### Lab Questions

1. Compare your solution to this exercise with the flow layout manager version. Describe the differences, is one easier to build than the other? Why or why not?
   1. The flex layout manager allows for more flexible and responsive designs compared to the flow layout manager. Flexbox is easier to build for complex layouts because it provides more control over alignment, spacing, and order of elements. The flow layout manager is simpler but less powerful for advanced layouts.
