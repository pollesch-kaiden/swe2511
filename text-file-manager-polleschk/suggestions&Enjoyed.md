### Suggestions & Improvements

I think that this project was very well laid out as there was even mark down files for each of the API's that were used, and how they were supposed to function. 

I think that the only suggestion I have would be to include a little more documentation on some of the other functions that were used so it wasn't a guessing game on what they were supposed to do.
