#### Suggestions & Improvements:

I think for this lab a little more description for what is expected for each part would be helpful. I think it could be improved by adding a little more detail to the instructions.

#### Enjoyed:

We liked learning about how Node.js can be applied to our coding projects with. And how Node.js can be incorporated with server handling requests.
