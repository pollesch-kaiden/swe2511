### Questions

Load the application in a web browser. In your own words, what does the application do?
- When loading the application in the web browser there is a page with a input box that spans the entire width of the screen with "Lorem ipsum" as the text. When there is text typed into the input box, it will filter out the entire text to just the words that contain the text from what is in the input box, the search is not case-sensitive. If there is no match to the input box then there will be no text shown on the screen. 

### Improvements

One improvement that we believe could be made to this Lab would be to add another checkbox for the user that says match case. This would allow the user to filter the text with the input box and also match the case of the text, making their search case-sensitive.

### Enjoyed

We enjoyed learning how the different React components work together to create a web application.
