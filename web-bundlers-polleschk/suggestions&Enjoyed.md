### Suggestions & Improvements

I would have liked some more guidance on how to use Vite.js, especially how to install, and get it running, as I didn't realize I needed to be in the `./src/` directory to have the vite command ```npx vite build --base./``` to work.  So being more specific on how to run it would be helpful.

### Enjoyed

I enjoyed learning how to troubleshoot things especially when it is something new because I feel like I learn more when I have to figure things out on my own. I also enjoyed learning a new tool, web bundlers, and how they can be used to bundle web applications.
