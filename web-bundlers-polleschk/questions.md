- **Purpose of a Web Bundler**
    - A web bundler is a tool that takes multiple files and bundles them together into a single file.  This is useful because it reduces the number of files that need to be loaded by the browser, which in turn reduces the number of HTTP requests that need to be made.  This can improve the performance of a web application by reducing the time it takes to load the application.
