# Factorial Function Usage

## Description

The factorial function computes the factorial of a non-negative integer \( n \). The factorial of \( n \) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to \( n \).

## Usage

1. Enter a non-negative integer in the input field labeled "Enter a number:" under the "Factorial" section.
2. The result will be displayed to the right of the "=" sign.
3. The factorial of the input number can be any positive number [0, 170] before displaying "infinity".

## Example

- Input: 5
- Output: 120  => 5! = (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120)
