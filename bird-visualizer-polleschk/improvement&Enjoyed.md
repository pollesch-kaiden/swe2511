## Suggestions/Improvement:

No suggestions or improvements it was a very thorough project and made sense.
I got all ny resources from the provided links, so I didn't have any extra resources other than where I got the images from which was: [Bird](https://freepngimg.com/png/26020-flying-bird-transparent-background) & [goHugo_Gophers](https://gohugo.io/)

## Enjoyed:

I really enjoyed learning how I can use an API and take that and map the actual data, as a visual representation. I love duck hunting so seeing where some ducks have been previously is very interesting to me!

I also enjoyed using the Google Charts again.
