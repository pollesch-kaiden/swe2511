# Kaiden Pollesch SWE2511 - 111 React Menu Filter 

### Suggestions & Improvements

I really enjoyed this lab, I think that the lab writeup was perfect and didn't have more than it needed. One thing I thought was fun was to figure out how to remove the allergens tag if there is no allergen, so making them add one or two of their own elements to the page(even if it isn't related to Culver's, but even something like a picture slideshow at the top of the menu items)

### Enjoyed

I enjoyed creating something that could really be used in the real world, or even I could if I kept up to date on the items with each allergen!

### Questions
