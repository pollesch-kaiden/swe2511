## Suggestions/Improvement:

No suggestions or improvements it was a very thorough project and made sense.
All resources were either listed in our [outsideSources.md](outsideSources.md) or listed in the [README.md](README.md)
## Enjoyed:

I really enjoyed learning how I can use an API and take that and map the actual data, as a visual representation. I love duck hunting so seeing where some ducks have been previously is very interesting to me!

I also enjoyed using the Google Charts again.
