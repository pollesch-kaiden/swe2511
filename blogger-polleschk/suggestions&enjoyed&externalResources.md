### Suggestions & Improvements
I think that one thing that could be improved would be to go over how to use MongoDB and Compass, I had a lot of trouble with it and I think that it would be helpful to have a little more guidance on how to use it.
<br>But other than that, I think that the project was very well done and I enjoyed working on it.

### Enjoyed
I enjoyed seeing the posts pop up in real time, with a time and date stamp, it was also very fun to use MongoDB and its compass to see exactly what is happening in the local server I was using. 

### External Resources
 - [Bootstrap Elements](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/forms/input-group/)
 - [MongoDB & Compass](https://faculty-web.msoe.edu/lembke/courses/swe2511/InstallMongoDB.html), I wasn't sure if this was in there because I was having problems with MongoDB, but I found it useful and I both MongoDB and Compass to work.
