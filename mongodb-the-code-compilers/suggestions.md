# Suggestions
We quite enjoyed the lab. The questions to be answered guided significant learning based on the pre-existing code was extremely well done.
The only suggestion that I had would be that in the instructions to run `npm install` could benefit from the note to make sure that you are in the src directory before trying to run the command.
