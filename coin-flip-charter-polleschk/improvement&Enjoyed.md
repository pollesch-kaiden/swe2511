## Suggestions/Improvement:

No suggestions or improvements it was a very thorough project and made sense, I had some problems with the chart not overlapping the text but found the problem!

## Enjoyed:

I enjoyed learning how I can take a set of data and put that data into a chart, then further manipulating that data to show exactly what I want with filtered data.
